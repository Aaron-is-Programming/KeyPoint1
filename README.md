# KeyPoint1
A keyboard accessory design for the Steam Deck.

This is a highly work in progress project also my first public project.
I am very busy so there may not be a lot of commits.

For the most part this is a diy project that mainly uses off the shelf parts and some uncommon parts like the keyboard.

The features of this device:
51wh Battery
USB-C Dock
TrackPoint
75% Keyboard
